## Project Summary
The following repository contains the data and code used for organization and statistical analysis from the manuscript *Decrease in Incidence of Diarrhea due to Cryptosporidium in Bangladesh Children is Associated with an Increase in anti-Cryptosporidium Antibody Avidity*, which has been accepted in the *Journal of Infectious Diseases*. 


## Experimental Setup
This analysis evaluates clinical features associated with plasma and fecal antibodies specific to Cryptosporidium in a child birth cohort in Bangladesh. Samples were collected from these children longitudinally over four years and history of Cryptosporidium infection was measured. IgG and IgA antibodies against Cryptosporidium antigens Cp17 and Cp23 were measured from plasma and stool samples and used for this analysis. This analysis includes organization of the number and type of Cryptosporidium infection for each individual from the cohort included in the analysis. Once organized, this data is then analyzed with antibody titers along with other collected metadata, including sex, household income, and child anthropometry.


## Software Implementation.
All source code required for each analysis is included within the `src` directory, while required metadata is included within the `data` directory. Packages required for this analysis are outlined within individual code files. Numbers within .R filenames indicate the order in which they should be run.

All data and source code included with this repository can be downloaded by cloning the git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/petrilab-uva/2024-CDI-vaccine.git

```
Alternatively, you can download a [zip archive of this repository](https://github.com/petrilab-uva/2024-CDI-vaccine/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
